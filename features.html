            <h2>Features of Our Automatic Pill Dispenser</h2>

            <h3 class="smart-art">What is our Solution?</h3>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                Our project is focused on designing and building an automatic pill dispenser to assist individuals who have difficulty remembering to take their medications. The system consists of a pill dispenser that is programmed to release the correct medication at a specified time, ensuring that the user receives the proper dose without needing to manually manage their pills. In addition to the dispenser, we have incorporated an alarm feature that activates at the scheduled time, alerting the user to take their medication. The device also includes a screen that displays a clear reminder message, reinforcing the alarm and providing visual confirmation of the task. The goal of this project is to improve medication adherence, particularly for individuals with cognitive impairments, busy schedules, or elderly users, by offering an easy-to-use, reliable solution that supports their health management and promotes greater independence.

            <p class="bubble-text">
                Our solution is an automatic pill dispenser designed to assist individuals who have difficulty remembering to take their medication on time. The system includes a programmable pill dispenser that releases the correct medication at scheduled times, eliminating the need for manual management of pills. To reinforce the reminder, an alarm will sound at the designated time, accompanied by a screen displaying a clear message prompting the user to take their medication. Additionally, the system is paired with a companion app that simplifies setup and provides extra support. If the user hasnâ€™t taken their medication within five minutes, the app can send reminders to caregivers or family members, ensuring an added layer of safety. This solution addresses medication non-adherence, particularly for individuals with cognitive impairments, busy schedules, or the elderly. By providing a reliable, user-friendly tool with smart monitoring features, our device ensures timely medication intake, enhances health management, and promotes independence for those who need it most.
