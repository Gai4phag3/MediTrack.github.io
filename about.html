            </p>

            <h3 class="smart-art">Our Mission</h3>
            <p class="bubble-text">

            <h3 class="smart-art">The Problem We Solve</h3>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                Many people face significant challenges in managing their medications:
            </p>
            <ul class="bubble-list">
                <li>Forgetting doses or taking the wrong medications.</li>
                <li>Missing prescription refills, causing treatment delays.</li>
                <li>Self-diagnosing symptoms without professional guidance.</li>
                <li>Dealing with fragmented solutions that fail to address all their needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                These problems result in gaps in treatment, reduced medication effectiveness, and severe health risks, especially for those with chronic conditions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="smart-art">Who Is Most Affected?</h3>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                Medication management is a universal issue, but certain groups face unique challenges:
            </p>
            <ul class="bubble-list">
                <li><strong>Seniors:</strong> Often managing multiple prescriptions, seniors may struggle with memory issues, complex schedules, and understanding medication instructions.</li>
                <li><strong>Children:</strong> Dependence on caregivers means improper dosing or missed doses can significantly impact their health and development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                Both groups are highly vulnerable to the risks of missed or incorrect medications, making it crucial to have an easy, reliable system in place.
            </p>

            <h3 class="smart-art">Current Solutions and Challenges</h3>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                While there are existing tools like medication reminder apps and pharmacy alerts, they often fall short. Most solutions address only part of the problem:
            </p>
            <ul class="bubble-list">
                <li>Reminders donâ€™t ensure timely refills or delivery.</li>
                <li>Symptom tracking and personalized guidance are often missing.</li>
                <li>Using multiple tools can be overwhelming, especially for seniors or caregivers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                Barriers such as lack of awareness, technological difficulties, costs, and privacy concerns further prevent people from getting the help they need.
            </p>

            <h3 class="smart-art">Our Solution</h3>
            <p class="bubble-text">
                MediTrack offers a comprehensive, user-friendly platform designed to close these gaps. By integrating reminders, refill tracking, symptom monitoring, and more, we empower users to take control of their health and achieve better outcomes.
